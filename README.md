**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Problem Statement
Industrial equipment such as pumps, compressors, and turbines are critical to energy operations. Unexpected failures cause downtime, safety hazards, and increased costs. Current maintenance approaches are mostly reactive (fix after failure) or preventive (fixed schedule, regardless of condition), leading to inefficiency.

There is a need for a data-driven predictive maintenance system that can forecast equipment failures in advance, ensure operational safety, and optimize maintenance schedules.

## 2. Project Goal
Develop a machine learning-powered predictive maintenance solution that monitors equipment sensor data, detects anomalies, predicts potential failures, and provides actionable insights through a dashboard.

## 3. Objectives
*   Enable early fault detection in rotating machinery (motors, pumps, turbines, compressors).
*   Provide real-time alerts when equipment health deteriorates.
*   Optimize maintenance schedules to reduce downtime and cost.
*   Improve Health, Safety, and Environment (HS&E) compliance by preventing hazardous failures.

## 4. Scope

### In Scope
*   Simulated or real-time sensor data ingestion (temperature, vibration, pressure).
*   Data preprocessing and storage.
*   Machine Learning models for anomaly detection and failure prediction.
*   Interactive dashboard for visualization and decision support.
*   Alerting system for threshold breaches.

### Out of Scope
*   Large-scale deployment across multiple facilities.
*   Hardware-level integration with proprietary industrial systems.
*   Advanced deep learning requiring massive datasets (may be future scope).

## 5. Users & Use Cases

### Primary Users
*   **Maintenance Engineers** – Monitor equipment health and plan servicing.
*   **Operations Managers** – Ensure continuous uptime and cost efficiency.
*   **Safety Officers (HS&E Teams)** – Reduce equipment-related risks.

### Use Cases
*   **Predictive Alerts** – System alerts when a pump shows vibration anomalies.
*   **Failure Forecasting** – ML model predicts compressor failure in 2 weeks → maintenance scheduled.
*   **Cost Optimization** – Instead of replacing parts every 3 months, the system suggests extending usage safely to 4.5 months.
*   **HS&E Compliance** – Detects overheating trends in turbine → avoids fire hazards.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### Data Ingestion Module
*   Input: IoT sensors or simulated data streams.
*   Support CSV, MQTT, or API input.

### Data Processing Module
*   Preprocess sensor data (cleaning, normalization, outlier detection).
*   Store in time-series database (optional: InfluxDB).

### ML Prediction Engine
*   Anomaly detection using SVM/Random Forest.
*   Time-to-failure prediction using regression models or LSTM (time-series).

### Dashboard & Visualization
*   Equipment health status (Normal / Warning / Critical).
*   Failure prediction timeline.
*   Trend analysis of vibration, temperature, and pressure.

### Alerts & Notifications
*   Trigger alerts when thresholds are breached.
*   Generate reports for managers and engineers.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** Process ≥100 sensor readings per second.
*   **Scalability:** Should support multiple machines.
*   **Reliability:** ≥95% model accuracy on test data.
*   **Security:** Access control for sensitive equipment data.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive dashboard (accessible via web browser).

## 8. Technology Stack
*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
*   **Visualization:** Streamlit / Power BI / Tableau
*   **Optional IoT Integration:** Raspberry Pi + sensors (vibration, temperature)

## 9. Success Metrics
*   **Prediction Accuracy** ≥ 90%
*   **Reduction in Downtime** by at least 20% (simulated use case)
*   **Maintenance Cost Savings** of ~15% compared to fixed schedule (simulated analysis)
*   **Safety Alerts** generated with <5% false positives

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
*   **Risk:** Limited real-world data → ML model accuracy may be low.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use open-source datasets (NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation dataset).
*   **Risk:** Overfitting of ML models.
    *   **Mitigation:** Apply cross-validation, regularization.
*   **Risk:** Dashboard performance issues with large data.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize queries, use caching.

## 11. Timeline (Suggested 6-Week Plan)
*   **Week 1–2:** Data collection & preprocessing.
*   **Week 3:** Develop ML models (anomaly detection + prediction).
*   **Week 4:** Build dashboard & visualization.
*   **Week 5:** Integrate alerts & reporting.
*   **Week 6:** Testing, optimization, documentation, and final presentation.

## 12. Deliverables
